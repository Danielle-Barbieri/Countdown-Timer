How to Grab a DOM Element
-1) Grab DOM elements (so we can play with it)
    const myEl = document.getElementById('my-id)
Things I Know How to Do With a DOM elements
0) Listen to click
1) Get value of input assuming its been grabbed
    myInputEl.value = const whateverTheUserTyped
2) Set value/text
    myEl.textContent = 'Some new thing'
3) Set color
    myEl.style.color = 'Red'
Other things you need to know: I can turn a string into a number 
Number('5')
What: 
1. 3 inputs
    to allow user to specify a value
        figure out what the user typed
2. Listen Button
    Figure out when to display
3. Div to display
    Place to display the answer

    Figure out what user typed: get value of inputs

    Getting value: 

   const whatIsInTheInput = input.value *how to get a value
   
   when to display: use the button = listen for a click
   myButton.addEventListener('click', () => { code in here will happen after click }

   setting text: for the div, you need to set the text content/display
   divEl.textContent = 'Something'

   go into website, inspect, store as global value, use temp1.value or textContent = ''


   Button is a 'why'
   .textContent is 'how' we change content
   .value is how we get data from an input, store it in a constant
   const whatTyped = inputEL.value
